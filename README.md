# github-issue-polls

Easily add a poll/survey and collect votes from GitHub issues.

### How it works

1. Go to [https://wakatime.com/polls][polls]
2. Paste a list of choices separated by newlines
3. Click the code icon to get markdown for your poll
4. Paste the markdown in your GH issue to show an image of your poll

People click the image, vote, then get redirected back to your issue with their vote showing in the image.

### This repo

Because the WakaTime Flask backend source code isnâ€™t publicly released, this repo contains the source code for only the polls feature at [https://wakatime.com/polls][polls].
